Key Analysis:

The key data was first assigned the proper letter key to the numerical key in the original data. 
The bins were then used to catgeorize the different levels of popularity.

Using the pie charts we were able to calculate and look at the percentage of each key in each bin. 
Using the bar charts we were able to look at the total count of songs for each key and each bin.
  Most Popular (90-100): The graphs suggest that G, A#, F#, and C# hold the largest sections of the entire bin. 
  Mid to High Popular (60-90): The graphs suggest that C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.
  Low to Mid Popular (30-59: The graphs suggest that C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.
  Least Popular (<30): The graphs suggest that G, C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.

The r-value shows us that there is no correlation between the popularity of a song and the key the song is written in. 
The r-value is not the best way to look at categorical data like the letter keys. The data collected and shown in the bar charts and pie charts though,
would suggest that it is more likely that a song would be written and become most popular in G, A#, F# and C#. Besides the r-value showing zero correlation
we can see that they key of a song does not determine the popularity of the song when we look at how specific keys are spread between each Popularity Sector.
For example 75% of key G songs are considered to be either Least Popular or Low to Mid Popular. This would suggest that a song written in G would likely not become popular
yet key G also holds the largets percentage of most popular songs. This is also shown in the fact that the stand out keys in each Popularity Sector hold stable for example C#
being in all four Popularity Sectors.
