Key Analysis:

The key data was first assigned the proper letter key to the numerical key in the original data. The bins were then used to catgeorize the different levels of popularity.

Using the pie charts we were able to calculate and look at the average percentage of each key in each bin. 
Using the bar charts we were able to look at the total count of songs for each key and each bin.
  Most Popular (90-100): The graphs suggest that G, A#, F#, and C# hold the largest sections of the entire bin. 
  Mid to High Popular (60-90): The graphs suggest that C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.
  Low to Mid Popular (30-59: The graphs suggest that C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.
  Least Popular (<30): The graphs suggest that G, C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.

Throughout the entire data set C#, C, G, and A# have the largest amount of songs written in this key so they are more likely to hold the higher 

Although the data would suggest these keys would be the best to write a song in because of their higher numbers of popularity the r-value shows us that there is no correlation between
the popularity of a song and the key the song is written in. The key's that were able to look the most popular in the data also had a larger number of songs written compared to the other
keys in the data.
