Key Analysis:

The key data was first assigned the proper letter key to the numerical key in the original data. 
The bins were then used to catgeorize the different levels of popularity.

Using the pie charts we were able to calculate and look at the percentage of each key in each bin. 
Using the bar charts we were able to look at the total count of songs for each key and each bin.
  Most Popular (90-100): The graphs suggest that G, A#, F#, and C# hold the largest sections of the entire bin. 
  Mid to High Popular (60-90): The graphs suggest that C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.
  Low to Mid Popular (30-59: The graphs suggest that C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.
  Least Popular (<30): The graphs suggest that G, C# and C hold the largest sections of the entire bin.

The r-value shows us that there is no correlation between the popularity of a song and the key the song is written in. 
The r-value is not the best way to look at categorical data like the letter keys. The data collected and shown in the bar charts and pie charts though,
would suggest that it is more likely that a song would be written and become most popular in G, A#, F# and C#. Besides the r-value showing zero correlation
we can see that they key of a song does not determine the popularity of the song when we look at how specific keys are spread between each Popularity Sector.
For example 75% of key G songs are considered to be either Least Popular or Low to Mid Popular. This would suggest that a song written in G would likely not become popular
yet key G also holds the largets percentage of most popular songs. This is also shown in the fact that the stand out keys in each Popularity Sector hold stable for example C#
being in all four Popularity Sectors.

Loudness Analysis:
Statistical Summary for Loudness Related to Popularity:
Central Tendency: The median loudness across all songs is -6.166 dB, with the mean slightly lower at -6.719 dB. 
This suggests that the loudness distribution is slightly skewed towards lower values, but not significantly.

Variability: The standard deviation is relatively small (2.988 dB), indicating that most songs have a loudness 
level close to the mean.

Range: The range of loudness is quite wide, from -46.448 dB to 1.275 dB, showing that there is a significant variation 
in the loudness of songs in the dataset.

Loudness Stats by Popularity Sector:
Least Popular (<30): Median loudness is very close to the overall median, with a slightly higher mean and similar standard
deviation. This indicates a consistent loudness profile with the overall dataset.

Low to Mid Popular (30-59): Similar loudness metrics to the least popular songs, with an identical mean and a very close median. 
The standard deviation is slightly larger, indicating a bit more variability in this group.

Mid to High Popular (60-89): A higher median and mean loudness than the less popular categories, suggesting that songs in this group
tend to be louder.

Most Popular (90-100): The median and mean loudness are closer to the mid to high popular group, but the standard deviation is smaller,
suggesting less variability in loudness among the most popular songs.

Box Plot and Histogram Observations:
The box plot shows that the median loudness is slightly higher for more popular songs, but not by a substantial margin.
The histograms display a general trend where the distribution of loudness shifts slightly towards higher loudness levels as popularity 
increases.

Correlation and Regression Analysis:
A correlation coefficient (r) of 0.06 suggests a very weak positive relationship between loudness and popularity.
The regression formula suggests that an increase in loudness is associated with a slight increase in popularity. However, the small 
coefficient for loudness (0.48) in the regression equation also indicates a weak effect.

Final Conclusion:
While there is a slight tendency for more popular songs to be louder, the relationship is not strong. The statistical analysis, 
visualized by the box plot and histograms, shows that while there is some variation in loudness across popularity sectors, it does 
not change dramatically. The weak correlation coefficient further supports this finding.The presence of songs with a wide range of 
loudness within each popularity bin suggests that factors other than loudness are more influential in determining a song's popularity.
Loudness may contribute slightly to a song's success, but it is likely one of many elements, such as genre, artist name recognition, 
marketing, and playlist placement, that have a more significant impact.In summary, loudness has a weak and statistically insignificant
correlation with popularity in this Spotify dataset. It plays a role in song popularity, but it is not a decisive factor.

Duration Analysi:
1.- Bar chart
The approach is to calculate the mean duration for each popularity sector and observe any trends that way we can determine if song duration 
is related to popularity and visualizes the results in a bar chart
Conclusion: We can see differences in song duration across different popularity sectors, there is a significant relationship between song 
duration and popularity where the longer the duration, the lower popularity.
2.- Scatter plots:
2.1.-Creating scatter plots is a great way to visually assess the relationship between song duration and popularity. Looks like there may 
be a negative trend, on average, longer songs might be associated with lower popularity.
We use matplotlib to generate scatter plots.
2.2.-Color:
This code uses seaborn.scatterplot to create a scatter plot with different colors
for each popularity sector, and the x-axis is labeled as "Duration (min)".
We see points scattered across the plot, each representing a song, and the
colors indicates the popularity sector.
Same results, Longer songs might be associated with lower popularity.
3.- Linear Regression Plot (scatter plot)
The calculated correlation coefficient (r-value) quantified the strength and direction of the linear relationship. A positive correlation 
suggests that, on average, longer songs might be associated with higher popularity, while a negative correlation implies the opposite. 
In this case, we have a negative correlation, so longer songs are not associated with higher popularity.A positive or negative correlation 
coefficient, along with the regression line's slope, provides valuable insights into the nature of the relationship. For instance, a negative
correlation indicates that as song duration increases, popularity tends to decrease, and vice versa.In conclusion, the linear regression 
analysis offers a quantitative understanding of the relationship between song duration and popularity.These insights can be leveraged for 
decision-making in the music industry, such as optimizing song lengths for audience engagement.

Genre Analysis:
Analysis for Genre
Based on a pie chart of the count of tracks by genre, each genre is represented 
evenly amongst the data.  The rap genre has the highest representation at 17.5% 
with the rock genre at the lowest 15.1%.
Since, genre is a categorical field it is not feasible to generate a linear regression 
plot.  Box plots were used to determine if there is a correlation between genre and 
popularity.  There is a slight correlation based on genre with latin and pop having 
higher popularity overall than other genres.
The popularity by genre can be shown to change over time.  We plotted the 
popularity of each genre by decade to represent these trends.  It is clear that pop 
was the most popular genre in the 1960s, while latin surpassed pop in the 1970s by 
a slim margin.  Rock was the most popular genre in both the 1980s and 1990s but 
again by a slight margin over pop.  By the 2000s latin and pop took over the top 
spot and both were surpassed slightly by rap in the 2010s.
A line plot was generated to dive deeper into the recent trends of genre popularity.  
Looking at the popularity trends from 2011 to 2020 it is clear that pop and rock 
have had the most consistent popularity scores.  Latin popularity was rather steady 
around 40 until 2016 and peaked at over 55 in 2019.  EDM has remained amongst 
the lowest in popularity but has continued to rise in popularity.  R&B went from 
among the lowest in popularity to rising to the top in 2019/2010.  While Rap steadily
rose until it reached the top in 2020.
It is clear that genre does have a correlation to popularity, however this correlation 
can change over time.  This is likely influenced by trending artists and age 
demographics of the consumer base.  It would be an interesting follow up study to 
compare average age of spotify consumers as it correlates to this data.  Another 
follow up may be to look at ethnicity of consumers. 
Analysis of data overall
- The mean of the popularity is 39.43 while the median is 42.0.  This shows 
that the data is skewed to the left and the median is a better representation 
of the data.  
- Digging deeper this is a result of approximately 2700 tracks having a 
popularity score of 0.  
- No outliers were identified in the data set.  Outliers would have been below -
25.5 and 106.5.  All of the popularity scores were within 0 and 100
