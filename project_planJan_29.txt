Project Plan -- 1.29.2024 -- for MSU Bootcamp Project 1

Project Objective
-----------------
Our team aims to analyze and understand the effects of Super Bowl victories on the winning teams' metropolitan areas. The central question we are exploring is: "How did winning the Super Bowl affect the winning team's metropolitan area - did it lead to positive or negative outcomes?"

Data Sources
-----------------
Census.org API for demographic and economic data.
Historical Super Bowl data (dates, winning cities).

Scope and Sample Size
-----------------
Time Frame: Analysis will encompass a period of 6 years surrounding each Super Bowl event (3 years pre and 3 years post).

Time Intervals: Data will be segmented into specific intervals: 3 years prior, 1 year prior, 6 months prior, at the event, 6 months after, 1 year after, and 3 years after.

Selected Super Bowl Dates and Winners:
January 26th, 2003: Tampa Bay Buccaneers
February 1st, 2004: Carolina Panthers
February 6th, 2005: Philadelphia Eagles
February 5th, 2006: Seattle Seahawks
February 4th, 2007: Chicago Bears

Team Structure
-----------------
Our team of five will each focus on one city, ensuring an equitable distribution of workload.
To add depth and dimension to our analysis, we will select three distinct socioeconomic zones within each metropolitan area (high, middle, low income), expanding our primary data points to 15 cities.

Key Research Questions
-----------------
Economic Health Impact: What were the overall economic health impacts, both positive and negative, on the winning cities?
Employment Rate Changes: How did employment rates in sectors like hospitality, retail, and transportation fluctuate before, during, and after the Super Bowl?
Income and Business Revenue: How did median household incomes and local business revenues vary during the same periods?
Population and Demographic Dynamics: Were there notable changes in population size or demographic composition around the time of the Super Bowl?

Data Visualization and Analysis
-----------------
We will employ various visualization techniques to present our findings, including trend charts for employment rates, graphs for income and business revenue changes, and demographic pie charts or population growth/decline graphs.
The analysis will be enriched by creating time intervals for each city, allowing a detailed temporal examination.
