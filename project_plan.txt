Project Plan -- 1.25.2024 -- for MSU Bootcamp Project 1 -- ROUGH DRAFT


What are we looking to solve for: "How did hosting the Super Bowl affect cities - did it lead to positive or negative outcomes?"

Cities: Atlanta, Tampa, New Orleans, San Diego, Houston
Years: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004

Main Question for All Cities:
How did hosting the Super Bowl positively or negatively impact the economic health of the city?
--This question is central to our project and will need help answering this question by supporting questions.

EXAMPLES OF SUPPORTING QUESTIONS:

1. Employment Changes: How did employment rates in key sectors (like hospitality, retail, and transportation) change in the months before, during, and after the Super Bowl?
Visualization Ideas: Charts showing employment rate trends in these sectors.

2. Income and Business Revenue Fluctuations: What were the changes in median household income and local business revenues in the city during the same periods?
Visualization Ideas: Graphs depicting changes in median household income and business revenues.

3. Population and Demographic Shifts: Were there any significant changes in the city's population size or demographic composition around the time of the Super Bowl?
Visualization Ideas: Demographic pie charts or population growth/decline graphs.

Expanding on the data:
1. we could choose three cities within each metropolitan for household median income or per capita income for each city - The Highest, Middle, and Lowest, which turns our 5 cities into 15 data points.  
2. Creating Time Intevals to add to each city analysis.

Time Intervals for Analysis:
6 Months Leading up to the Super Bowl: To capture the preparatory phase and anticipatory economic activities.
Month of the Super Bowl: Focusing on the immediate impact during the event.
6 Months After the Super Bowl: To observe short-term post-event effects.
1 Year After the Super Bowl: To assess longer-term economic impacts.

What this data would look like in a couple different ways:
Date (2000)	Metric	Atlanta (A)	Highest Median City (X)	Middle Median City (Y)	Lowest Median City (Z)
7/1/2019	Employment Rate (%)	93.5	95	91.5	88.5
7/1/2019	Median Household Income	49,500	69,500	44,500	29,500
7/1/2019	Population Size	448,000	498,000	348,000	198,000
8/1/2019	Employment Rate (%)	93.7	95.2	91.7	88.7
8/1/2019	Median Household Income	49,750	69,750	44,750	29,750
8/1/2019	Population Size	448,500	498,500	348,500	198,500
â€¦	...	...	...	...	...
1/1/2000	Employment Rate (%)	94	95.5	92	89
1/1/2000	Median Household Income	50,000	70,000	45,000	30,000
1/1/2000	Population Size	450,000	500,000	350,000	200,000

or a summary table like this:
Metric	Atlanta (A)	Highest Median City (X)	Middle Median City (Y)	Lowest Median City (Z)
Pre-Super Bowl (6 Months)				
Employment Rate (%)	94	95.5	92	89
Median Household Income (USD)	50,000	70,000	45,000	30,000
Population Size	450,000	500,000	350,000	200,000
During Super Bowl (Month)				
Employment Rate (%)	94.5	95.7	92.2	89.2
Median Household Income (USD)	51,000	71,000	46,000	30,500
Population Size	455,000	505,000	355,000	202,000

And thats just for three metrics of employment rate, median household income, and population size, we can do a lot more than that!
